# Algorithms and Data Structures
Just started learning Algorithms and Data Structures from one of the best books "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen. I'm very much excited to open the next mysterious box in my learning journey. And I think it will serve as a big leap in improving my programming skills. Although algorithms are not so much in use nowadays, it will definitely improve my logical thinking and coding skills😁
